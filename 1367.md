# Linked List is a Subpath in a Binary Tree 

Given a binary tree root and a linked list with head as the first node. 

Return True if all the elements in the linked list starting from the head 
correspond to some downward path connected in the binary tree otherwise return False.

In this context downward path means a path that starts at some node and goes downwards.

## Example 1:

    Input: head = [4,2,8], root = [1,4,4,null,2,2,null,1,null,6,8,null,null,null,null,1,3]
    Output: true
    Explanation: Nodes in blue form a subpath in the binary Tree.
    
## Example 2:

    Input: head = [1,4,2,6], root = [1,4,4,null,2,2,null,1,null,6,8,null,null,null,null,1,3]
    Output: true
    
## Example 3:

    Input: head = [1,4,2,6,8], root = [1,4,4,null,2,2,null,1,null,6,8,null,null,null,null,1,3]
    Output: false
    Explanation: There is no path in the binary tree that contains all the elements of the linked list from head.
     

## Constraints:

    The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range [1, 2500].
    The number of nodes in the list will be in the range [1, 100].
    1 <= Node.val <= 100 for each node in the linked list and binary tree.

#Solution:

## Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The problem asks if a given linked list exists as a downward path in a binary tree. My first thought is that this can be approached similarly to a path-finding problem in trees. If we can start from any node in the tree and recursively match the linked list with a downward path in the tree, we can determine if the linked list is a subpath.
## Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. Depth-First Search (DFS) Matching: For each node in the binary tree, check if the linked list starting at the head can match a path in the tree starting from that node. This is done using a helper function dfs that tries to match the linked list with a path in the tree.
2. Recursive Tree Traversal: In the main function isSubPath, we recursively check every node of the binary tree as a potential starting point for the linked list. If a node's value matches the current linked list node, we invoke the dfs function to see if the entire linked list can be matched from that node.
3. Base Cases: The DFS function checks if the linked list has been fully matched (return true), or if the tree path cannot continue (return false). The main function returns true if a match is found starting from any node, and false otherwise.
## Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
The time complexity is 

O(n√óm), where n is the number of nodes in the tree and m is the length of the linked list. This is because, in the worst case, we might have to start the DFS from each tree node, and each DFS may involve checking the entire linked list.
- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursive stack used in the DFS. The space used by the linked list is constant O(1) since we are not storing anything additionally based on its length.
## Code[Java]
```java []

class Solution {
public:
    bool dfs(ListNode* head, TreeNode* node) {
        if (head == nullptr) return true;       
        if (node == nullptr) return false;      
        if (head->val != node->val) return false; 
        return dfs(head->next, node->left) || dfs(head->next, node->right);
    }

    bool isSubPath(ListNode* head, TreeNode* root) {
        if(root==nullptr) return false;
        if(root->val == head->val){
            if(dfs(head,root)){
                return true;
            }
        }
        return isSubPath(head,root->left)||isSubPath(head, root->right);
    }
};
```
