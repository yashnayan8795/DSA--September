# Split-Llinked-List-in-Parts

Given the head of a singly linked list and an integer k, split the linked list into k consecutive linked list parts.

The length of each part should be as equal as possible: no two parts should have a size differing by more than one.
This may lead to some parts being null.

The parts should be in the order of occurrence in the input list, and parts occurring earlier should 
always have a size greater than or equal to parts occurring later.

Return an array of the k parts.

 

## Example 1:


    Input: head = [1,2,3], k = 5
    Output: [[1],[2],[3],[],[]]
    Explanation:
    The first element output[0] has output[0].val = 1, output[0].next = null.
    The last element output[4] is null, but its string representation as a ListNode is [].
## Example 2:


    Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], k = 3
    Output: [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7],[8,9,10]]
    Explanation:
    The input has been split into consecutive parts with size difference at most 1, and earlier parts are a larger size than the later parts.
 

## Constraints:

    The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 1000].
    0 <= Node.val <= 1000
    1 <= k <= 50

Solution:

Java
  
    class Solution {
        public ListNode[] splitListToParts(ListNode head, int k) {
            ListNode temp = head;
            int size=0;
            while(temp!=null){
                size++;
                temp = temp.next;
            }
            ListNode res[] = new ListNode[k];
            temp = head;
            int avg = size/k;
            int extra = size%k;
            for(int i=0;i<k;i++){
                if(temp==null) break;
                ListNode curHead = temp;
                ListNode prev = null;
                int len=0;
                while(temp!=null && len<avg){
                    prev = temp;
                    temp = temp.next;
                    len++;
                }
                if(extra>0){
                    prev = temp;
                    temp = temp.next;
                    extra--;
                }
                prev.next = null; 
                res[i] = curHead; 
            }
            return res;
        }
    }

  ### steps:

  1.Calculate the Length of the Linked List:

    Initialize a temporary pointer temp to the head of the linked list.
    Traverse the linked list to calculate its length (size).
    Set temp to the next node in each iteration until the end of the list is reached (temp == null).
  2. Initialize the Result Array:

    Create an array res of ListNode objects with a size of k. This will store the head of each split part.
    Determine the Size of Each Part:
    
    Calculate the average size of each part using integer division: avg = size / k.
    Calculate the number of parts that will have one extra node (because size % k nodes won't evenly distribute): extra = size % k.
  3. Split the Linked List:

    Reset temp to the head of the linked list.
  4 .Iterate k times to split the linked list into k parts:
        For each part:
          Set curHead to the current node (temp) which will be the head of the current part.
          Use a pointer prev to keep track of the previous node as you traverse.
          Traverse the list for avg nodes to get the base size of each part.
          If extra > 0, move one additional node to this part and decrement extra.
          Set the next pointer of the prev node to null to terminate the current part.
          Store curHead in the result array at the current index.
          Move temp to the next node to start the next part.
  5. Return the Result:

    Return the array res containing the heads of the split parts.
### Example Walkthrough:
    Suppose we have a linked list with 10 nodes and k = 3.
    
    The size of the linked list is 10, so:
    
    avg = 10 / 3 = 3 (each part should have 3 nodes as the base size).
    extra = 10 % 3 = 1 (1 part should have one extra node).
    The linked list will be split into:
    
    The first part with 4 nodes (3 + 1).
    The second part with 3 nodes.
    The third part with 3 nodes.
