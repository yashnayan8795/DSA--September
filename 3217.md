# Delete-Nodes-From-Linked-List-Present-In-Array

You are given an array of integers nums and the head of a linked list. 
Return the head of the modified linked list after removing all nodes 
from the linked list that have a value that exists in nums.

## Example 1:

    Input: nums = [1,2,3], head = [1,2,3,4,5]
    Output: [4,5]
  Explanation:Remove the nodes with values 1, 2, and 3.

## Example 2:

    Input: nums = [1], head = [1,2,1,2,1,2]
    Output: [2,2,2]
  Explanation:Remove the nodes with value 1.

## Example 3:

    Input: nums = [5], head = [1,2,3,4]
    Output: [1,2,3,4]
  Explanation:No node has value 5.

## Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 105
    1 <= nums[i] <= 105
    All elements in nums are unique.
    The number of nodes in the given list is in the range [1, 105].
    1 <= Node.val <= 105
  The input is generated such that there is at least one node in the linked list that has a value not present in nums.


  Solution:
  Cpp-

      class Solution {
      public:
          ListNode* modifiedList(vector<int>& nums, ListNode* head) {
              unordered_set<int> s(nums.begin(), nums.end());
              ListNode* d =new ListNode(0,head);
              for(ListNode* pre =d; pre-> next;)
              {
                  if(s.count(pre-> next->val)){
                      pre->next =pre->next->next;
                  }else{
                      pre = pre->next;
                  }
              }
              return d->next;
          }
      };

Algorithm:-)
    Initialize Data Structures:
    
      Create an unordered_set to store the values from the nums vector for efficient lookup.
      Create a Dummy Node:
    
      Initialize a dummy node with an arbitrary value (e.g., 0), and set its next pointer to the head of the given linked list.
      The dummy node helps handle edge cases, such as removing the head of the list.
      Iterate Through the Linked List:
      
      Initialize a pointer (pre) to the dummy node.
      Traverse the linked list using the pre pointer, which starts at the dummy node and continues as long as pre->next is not nullptr.
      
    Remove Nodes:
    
      For each node:
          Check if the value of the current node (pre->next->val) is in the unordered_set.
      If it is:
          Bypass the node by setting pre->next to pre->next->next.
      If it is not:
          Move the pre pointer to the next node (pre = pre->next).
      Return the Modified List:
          Return the list starting from d->next (i.e., the node following the dummy node).
