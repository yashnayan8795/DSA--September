# Convert-1d-array-into-2d-array

You are given a 0-indexed 1-dimensional (1D) integer array original, and two integers, m and n. 
You are tasked with creating a 2-dimensional (2D) array with  m rows and n columns using all the
elements from original.
The elements from indices 0 to n - 1 (inclusive) of original should form the first row of the 
constructed 2D array, the elements from indices n to 2 * n - 1 (inclusive) should form the second 
row of the constructed 2D array, and so on.

Return an m x n 2D array constructed according to the above procedure, or an empty 2D array if it is impossible.

 
Example 1:

    Input: original = [1,2,3,4], m = 2, n = 2
    Output: [[1,2],[3,4]]
    Explanation: The constructed 2D array should contain 2 rows and 2 columns.
    The first group of n=2 elements in original, [1,2], becomes the first row in the constructed 2D array.
    The second group of n=2 elements in original, [3,4], becomes the second row in the constructed 2D array.

    
Example 2:

    Input: original = [1,2,3], m = 1, n = 3
    Output: [[1,2,3]]
    Explanation: The constructed 2D array should contain 1 row and 3 columns.
    Put all three elements in original into the first row of the constructed 2D array.

Example 3:

    Input: original = [1,2], m = 1, n = 1
    Output: []
    Explanation: There are 2 elements in original.
    It is impossible to fit 2 elements in a 1x1 2D array, so return an empty 2D array.
 
## Constraints:

    1 <= original.length <= 5 * 104
    1 <= original[i] <= 105
    1 <= m, n <= 4 * 104


## Submitted Code:

   JAVA
   
    class Solution {
        public int[][] construct2DArray(int[] original, int m, int n) {
            if(original.length != m*n){
                return new int[][]{};
            }
            int [][] res=new int[m][n];
            int r=0,c=0;
            for(int o:original){
                res[r][c++] = o;
                if(c==n){
                    r++;
                    c=0;
                }
            }
            return res;
        }
    }



### Method Signature

```java
public int[][] construct2DArray(int[] original, int m, int n)
```
- **`int[] original`**: This is the input 1D array that contains the values you want to put into the 2D array.
- **`int m`**: The number of rows for the new 2D array.
- **`int n`**: The number of columns for the new 2D array.
- **Returns**: A 2D array of dimensions `m` by `n` if possible; otherwise, an empty 2D array.

### Code Breakdown

1. **Check if Conversion is Possible**

    ```java
    if(original.length != m * n) {
        return new int[][]{};
    }
    ```
    - This checks if the total number of elements in `original` is exactly equal to the number of elements needed for the `m x n` 2D array. If not, it returns an empty 2D array because it's impossible to construct the desired 2D array with the given `m` and `n`.

2. **Initialize the 2D Array**

    ```java
    int [][] res = new int[m][n];
    ```
    - Creates a new 2D array `res` with `m` rows and `n` columns.

3. **Filling the 2D Array**

    ```java
    int r = 0, c = 0;
    for(int o : original) {
        res[r][c++] = o;
        if(c == n) {
            r++;
            c = 0;
        }
    }
    ```
    - `r` and `c` are used to keep track of the current row and column in the 2D array.
    - The `for` loop iterates over each element in the `original` array.
    - `res[r][c++] = o;` assigns the current element `o` from `original` to the `res` array at position `[r][c]`, and then `c` is incremented to move to the next column.
    - When `c` reaches `n` (meaning the current row is full), it resets `c` to `0` and increments `r` to move to the next row.

4. **Return the Result**

    ```java
    return res;
    ```
    - Finally, the method returns the 2D array `res` that has been filled with elements from the `original` array.

### Example

Let's say `original = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, `m = 2`, and `n = 3`. 

- `original.length` (which is 6) matches `m * n` (which is also 6), so the conversion is possible.
- The `res` array is initialized as `new int[2][3]`.
- The loop fills `res` as follows:
  - Place `1` at `res[0][0]`, then increment `c`.
  - Place `2` at `res[0][1]`, then increment `c`.
  - Place `3` at `res[0][2]`, then `c` equals `n` so reset `c` to `0` and increment `r`.
  - Place `4` at `res[1][0]`, then increment `c`.
  - Place `5` at `res[1][1]`, then increment `c`.
  - Place `6` at `res[1][2]`, then `c` equals `n` but there are no more elements.

The resulting 2D array `res` would be:

```
[[1, 2, 3],
 [4, 5, 6]]
```

The code efficiently converts a 1D array into a 2D array if the dimensions are valid, and handles the conversion using simple indexing.
